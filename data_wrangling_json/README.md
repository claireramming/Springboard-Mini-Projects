### In this project:

We use data from the world banks projects to explore the following:

* the json package
* importing json files to pandas dataframes
* answer the following questions:  
	1. Find the 10 countries with most projects
	2. Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
	3. In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.
